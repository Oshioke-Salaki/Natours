1. JSON.parse converts json to a JS object or an array of JS objects

2. Always version your api

3. without the next() in our middleware, the app will be stuck in this part of the code i.e. we wont be able to get a response.

4. Middle wares are used in between the request and response cylce i.e they are activated when request are sent.

5. const app = express(); 
Sets a new instance for express and allows the variable, app to use all the express methods.

6. router.param('id', (req, res, next, val)=>{
    next();
  })
  this is for creating a params middle ware which is activated when there is a certain parameter in our route, in this case, ID....val is for the val of the parameter passed.
